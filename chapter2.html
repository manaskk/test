    <h3>chapter 1</h3>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature</em>,<em>new scientist</em>,and all the other<br>
    scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em>On The Road.</em>it had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she<br>spent in these four walls the more she felt
    she needed to be free.</p>
